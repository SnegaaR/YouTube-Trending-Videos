# YouTube-Trending-Videos

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. 
According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of 
factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note 
that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube 
trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile 
“Gangnam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dudewith-a-camera viral videos 
that YouTube is well-known for.

This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.
